# What am I?

I am a restaurant menu system for restaurant 
owners and employees, and their customers.

The customer can access the menu using a qr 
code, select and view details about the 
individual menu items, and check their 
availability.

The app is built in django and features an 
admin interface, which can be accessed by 
cooks, etc., who can add/remove and edit the 
menu items, and enter prices. The individual 
items are grouped in categories
